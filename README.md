# Control Snippets &middot; [![Visual Studio Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/visual-studio-marketplace/v/svipas.control-snippets.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svipas.control-snippets)

Disable or enable VS Code's built-in snippets and manually installed snippets from extensions.

## Installation

Install through VS Code extensions, search for `Control Snippets` by `Benas Svipas`.

## Usage

1. Open Command Palette.
2. Write `Control Snippets` and disable or enable any snippets from extensions.
3. Reload or restart VS Code.

## FAQ

### I still see built-in snippets or extensions snippets

&#x26a0; Reload or restart of VS Code is required after disable or enable snippets from extensions to take effect.

### I got _"Extensions have been modified on disk. Please reload the window."_ message

If you got **"Extensions have been modified on disk. Please reload the window."** message that means VS Code detected changes in extensions and reload of VS Code is required. After reload of VS Code you will not get that message and snippets would be enabled or disabled.

### After VS Code update

After VS Code update you will probably have to repeat same steps you did before to disable or enable specific snippets for extensions.
